# refreshCheckers
A webpage that allows two users to play a game of Checkers.

Takes advantage of both the Bootstrap and FatFree frameworks.

Uses a database to hold each of the 64 tiles on a Checkerboard and each tile will store a value of either "color1", "color2" or "null" to determine whether a piece is on that tile or not.
